## Want to know if there's a method to win against a bookmaker ? 

Here is a personnal project that I made to test my skills in Data Analysis, so I could see what I could do with it. 

To summarizer this project, I created a strategy that tries to beat a bookmaker. I gathered 10 year results of 5 football leagues and worked with it.
The strategy is to bet every time on the favourite team. If I win, I do it again. If I loose, I multiply my stake so I can reimburse my losses and make profits (until I have a winning bet, I keep multiplying).

The danger here is that too many losses in a row and you won't have enough money to keep rising the stakes.
But I wanted to know if by betting only on the favourite teams, we could keep going year after year without loosing all our money.

You can download the folder and launch the python program in Jupyter Notebook. You have 5 interactive parameters(as you can see below), so you can see by yourself if this is a winning strategy or not. Don't hesitate to try different combinations, the results may be completely different from one another.
